A wonderful multipuropose and fully customizable bot I wrote in my spare time.

# Things the bot can do
- Some moderation tools
- Fun commands
- Music (wow)
- Automatic responses
- Your very own cringe channel (Requires some setup)
- A word filter (Requires some setup)
- Welcome messages
- Every user gets their own prefix
- thats about it but still pretty cool right?

# Things you can do with the bot
- Take its organs and work them into your own bot (dont worry I wont judge)
- Add it to your server as is
- yeah
